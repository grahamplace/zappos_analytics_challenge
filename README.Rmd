### Intro
Hi! I'm Graham.

***

### Tools
I work primarily in R, though I have a functional knowledge of Excel and know enough Python to get by with pandas and lots of Googling. 

All of my code, cleaned data, and presentation files can be found in [this github repo.](https://github.com/grahamplace/zappos_analytics_challenge)

### Workflow

My workflow for this project went something like this: 

**Convert data to CSV -> Load CSV into RStudio -> Munge/Clean Data -> Visualize/Explore -> Use inisghts to draw actionable business conclusions -> Turn conclusions into pretty powerpoint slides **
